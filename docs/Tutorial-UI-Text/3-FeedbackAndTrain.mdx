Each time you ask a question, the system tries to find answers to which it associates a confidence score. The different answers are ordered by confidence (from the higher score to the lower).

By using the feedback functionality, i.e. by clicking on either the thumbs-up 👍, thumb-down 👎 or by selecting yourself the right answer, the system can learn better to answer your questions.

## Giving feedbacks

When asking "Who is the wife of Homer Simpson?" the first time, the system will return these answers, by giving feedbacks you can then train your system. You can then see that the results changed.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="q1" label="Giving feedbacks" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/simpsons/who-is-homer-wife.png' alt='who is the wife of homer'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q3" label="After training" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/simpsons/who-is-homer-wife-after-training.png' alt='who is the wife of homer'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The more you give feedbacks, the more your training set will grow and the more accurate your system will be.

## Training

You can access the **Training** page using the button in the status bar (on top of you screen) or in the **QA Systems** page by clicking on the QA system you are interested in and then the *Training* button.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '10px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <img src='/img/newUI/simpsons/status-bar.png' alt='training button' width= '60%'/>
    <img src='/img/newUI/simpsons/qa-system-training-btn.png' alt='training button' width= '60%'/>
</div>

This page allows you to see the feedbacks corresponding to your QA system. If you did not give feedbacks yet, a training set for the simpsons dataset can be downloaded here:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <Link
        target='_blank'
        to='/questions_simpsons.jsonl'
        download
        className="button button--primary button--lg"
    >
        Download training set 🍩
    </Link>
</div>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="q2" label="No feedbacks yet">
    <Image src='/img/newUI/simpsons/training-empty.png' alt='new feedbacks'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='q1' label='You already have some feedbacks' default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/simpsons/training.png' alt='existing feedbacks'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
Your feedbacks are displayed using a color code:
- Green: you gave 👍 and the system was correct
- Red: you gave 👍 but the system was incorrect
- Grey: you gave 👎

## Annotation

To use *Annotation mode* you can go on your **Training Page** and click on the *Annotate* button. 

The annotation mode allows you to give feedbacks on the system's answers, but also to search for an answer inside the document collection if the system did not find it.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="q1" label="Open annotation mode" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/simpsons/annotate.png' alt='annotate'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q3" label="Ask question" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/simpsons/annotate-marge-hair-color.png' alt='ask question'/>
    You can give feedbacks on these answers, the same way as you do in the <b>Ask page</b>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q4" label="Browse documents" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/simpsons/annotate-marge-hair-color-select-doc.png' alt='ask question'/>
    If you want to stop selecting text, you can click on the button next to the <i>Check system's answers</i> button.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


The feedbacks you give by selecting the answer inside the document collection will have as type "Annotated by user" so you can find them easily in the **Training Page**.
