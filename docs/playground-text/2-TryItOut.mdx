The playground is separated in two parts:
- **Left** is your *Context*: the text you want to ask questions about
- **Right** is where you ask your questions: ask ypur question, its answer will appear below

You can use the *Example* text to try out the playground, modify it and see what happens or you can use your own text!

<Image src='/img/newUI/playground-text/1-who-are-you.png' alt='QA Systems'/>

Here are some questions you can ask:
1. Who developed you?
2. How old are you?
3. What language do you speak?
4. In what languages are you coded?
5. What do you eat?
6. Who developed you?
7. Where do you live?

Don't hesitate to **try more questions**, modify the context and experiment with the playground!
