The playground is separated in two parts:
- **Left** is your *Context*: the text you want to ask questions about;
- **Right** is where you ask your questions: ask your question, its answer will appear below

You can use the *Example* text to try out the playground, modify it and see what happens or you can use your own text!

Here are some questions you can ask:
1. Who developed you?
2. What do you like
3. What language do you speak?
4. In what languages are you coded?
5. Where do you live?

Don't hesitate to **try more questions**, modify the context and experiment with the playground!
