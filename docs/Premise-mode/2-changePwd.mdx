Since regular users can't create their account on their own (only an administrator can), they don't chose their password. 

But don't worry, you can change it afterward on you [profile page](https://app.qanswer.ai/user)! 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='b1' label='Before'>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/premise/profile-page.png' alt='profile page'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="a1" label="After" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/premise/profile-page-change-pwd.png' alt='profile page change password'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
This page is also available for users that are not in *On premise mode*.
