The Search inteface allows you to share your AI Assistant with anyone you want.
* You must choose if it is accessible for everyone or someone with a loggedin account.
* You can write a description.
* You have access to the link to share with somebody.

When someone clicks on the link, it will redirect them to your AI Assistant's search functionality, but without them accessing your account.
They first see the description you enter, after closing the desciption popup they will be able to ask questions to the AI Assistant.
