You may have at your disposal RDF data and documents about a common subject. For example:

* the cocktail RDF dataset we used in [Tutorial UI Graph](/tutorial-ui/rdf-based/rdf-to-qa)
* a pdf about cocktails and their history (here we will use data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail))

You would like to have answers on both those data sources. You can **combine** 2 QA Systems (one based on RDF data and one based on documents) so you can query both sources at once.


## Access

## Create a combined QA System
:::info
You need two existing QA Systems (one of each type **RDF** and **Document**) to create a combined QA System.
:::

First click on the **Add** button and choose **Combined**. You will arrive here:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-combined/combined-wizard-empty.png' alt='Combined QA System creation'/>

<p>
  Here are the QA Systems you have access to, shared ones included. They can be differentiated by their 
  <img src='/img/icons/shared.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
  icon. 
</p>

You can select one system of each type (RDF and Document). These two systems must have a common language, and it will be automatically filled in the language field.

    <Admonition type='tip'>
    <p>
        You can also use 
        <img src='/img/icons/shared.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
        shared QA Systems to create your combined one.
      </p>
    </Admonition>
</div>

:::caution
If the owner of a shared QA System deletes it, your combined QA System will be deleted too.
:::

Once you have selected two QA Systems, you can click on **Finish**. Your combined QA System is now created and you can query it, it appears in your home page like the other QA Systems.

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-combined/home-page-new-combined.png' alt='Here is your new combined QA System'/>

You may have noticed that combined systems do not impact your quotas. You can create as many as you want.

As you can see you can query it like any other QA System. You can also share it with other users.

## Query

You can now query 2 types of data at once meaning you can ask questions like:
- What are margarita ingredients?
- When was the term "cocktail" first mentioned as a beverage?

You will get **answer from the most adapted** sub QA System. For example, if you ask "What are margarita ingredients?", you will get an answer from the RDF QA System because it has a better knowledge of ingredients. If you ask "When was the term 'cocktail' first mentioned as a beverage?", you will get an answer from the Document QA System because it has a better knowledge of history.

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-combined/combined-text-answer-first-mention.png' alt='When was the term "cocktail" first mentioned as a beverage?'/>

:::note
We try to prioritize answers based on RDF data because they are more precise. If the answer's confidence exceeds 50%, we will display it. If not, we will display the answer from the Document based QA System.
:::

<div>
    <Admonition type='tip'>
    <p>
        You can switch between the two answers by clicking on the button at the right of the search bar. It will look like this 
        <img src='/img/icons/qa-system-default/text.svg' alt='text logo' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/> 
        to show the text answer and like this
        <img src='/img/icons/qa-system-default/graph.svg' alt='kg logo' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/> 
        to show the RDF based answer.
      </p>

</div>

## Feedbacks and training

You can give feedbacks on a combined QA System like you would on a normal QA System.

:::info
The feedbacks will be saved in the sub QA System corresponding to the answer you gave feedback on.
:::

There is no training page for a combined QA System, but you can train the sub QA Systems separately.

:::tip
To improve your results on your combined QA System it is recommended to give feedbacks and train both sub QA Systems.
:::


## Sharing

You can also share your combined QA System like your other QA System. You may have sharing restrictions if you used shared QA Systems to create your combined one.

:::info
First, note that in order to share a combined QA System, **the same sharing options will be applied** to both QA Systems you used to create it (let's call them sub QA Systems).
:::

1. You own the 2 sub QA Systems **or** you have "Read and **Write**" access to both of them
    - You can share your combined QA System with any user and choose their rights. They will have the same access to the sub QA Systems. 
    - You can open your combined QA System to the public. The sub QA Systems will be open to the public too.

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-combined/share-owned.png' alt='share'/>


2. You have "Read **only**" access to one or both sub QA Systems
    - You can share your combined QA System with any user but the rights are restricted to "Read only", this will be the same for the sub QA Systems.
    - You cannot open your combined QA System to the public.

## Deletion / Unsharing

A combined QA System is a combination of two sub QA Systems, and deleting or unsharing actions can have consequences on other systems.

| Action | Effect on Combined QA System | Effect on Sub QA Systems |
|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Deleting a combined system | *Deleted the combined system* | - |
| Unsharing a combined system | *Unshares the combined system* | Sub systems stay shared |
| Deleting a sub-system | Deletes the combined system | *Only deletes the specific sub-system* |
| Unsharing a sub-system | Unshares the combined system | *Only unshares the specific sub-system* |

Please note that when deleting a QA System that is used by one of your combined QA Systems, a confirmation step is added to prevent unintended deletion.

However, if the QA System is shared, we do not check if it is being used by any of your shared users, so please exercise caution.
