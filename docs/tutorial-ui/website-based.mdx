You might have experienced searching for a particular question on a website and then going through the entire page to find the answer. This is a very tedious task and can be easily automated using a QA System. 

:::tip
Sometimes searching information through a website can be very tedious. So why don't you try our QA Systems over websites?
Let's see how do to it!
:::

In this section we will learn how to create a website based QA System. 

## Access
:::note
To access the creation page, check [Introduction and Access](/tutorial-ui/access) section!

You will get [there](https://app.qanswer.ai/qa-systems/website):

## Add your first website

To add your first website, enter its URL in the input field and click on *Add* or press *Enter*.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='input' label='Input'>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/website-based/website-first-input.png' alt='Add first link'/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='added' label='Added' default>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/website-based/website-first-add.png' alt='Add first link'/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can see your website appearing in the list of websites.

<Admonition type='info'>
    <p>
        At the left of your URL you can see a button 
        <span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>
            <img src='/img/icons/search.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
            <b style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#3d82b3', marginRight: '10px' }}>Explore and Extract</b>
        </span>
        button. Click it to extract the sub-pages of this website.
    </p>
</Admonition>

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='g1' label='Group sub-pages'>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/website-based/website-after-extract.png' alt='Grouped sub-pages'/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='s1' label='Show sub-pages' default>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/website-based/website-show-extracted.png' alt='Show sub-pages'/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

As you can see, you now have a list of your website and its sub-pages, which can be grouped to see more clearly.

## Handle sub-pages
### Delete sub-pages

Some sub-pages might not interest you, you can remove them by clicking on the delete button (in the *Action* column).

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/website-based/website-remove.png' alt='Remove'/>

### Move sub-pages

Your sub-pages are originally grouped but you can move them **out of their group** by clicking on the *Move* button (in the *Action* column).

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='g1' label='Before' default>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/website-based/website-move-sub-url.png' alt='before moving'/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='s1' label='After'>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/website-based/website-after-moving-sub-url.png' alt='after moving'/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once your sub-page is moved out of its group, you can also *Explore and Extract* it like you did for the main website.

## Creation
Once you picked the name, language of your QA System and filtered your links, you can click on:
* <kbd>Settings</kbd> to personnalize them (default parameters are good for general use)
* <kbd>Finish</kbd> to create your QA System (and use default parameters)

:::info
The settings are the same as **Document-based** QA Systems. Check [Settings](/tutorial-ui/document-based/upload-index#settings-optional) section for more information.
