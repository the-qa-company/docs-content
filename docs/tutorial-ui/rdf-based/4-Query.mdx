For the "Cocktails" QA system you could ask for example: 
- What is a Margarita?
- What are the ingredients of Margarita?

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='q1' label='Question 1' default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/margarita.png' alt='margarita'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q2" label="Question 2">
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/margarita-ingredients.png' alt='margarita ingredients'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the section [Contextual information](contextual-information) we will see the different ways an answer can be displayed based on the contextual information that is available.

The dataset contains some popular cocktails like: Margarita, Sex on the Beach, Long Island Iced Tea and Grasshopper.
