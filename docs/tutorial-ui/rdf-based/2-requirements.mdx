In this section we are going to describe in detail what are the requirements that we make on the RDF datasets that can be indexed by QAnswer.

## Label
To be able to answer questions, QAnswer needs to know how to translate a question into a SPARQL query. To do so, QAnswer uses the labels attached to the URIs in the RDF dataset. 

:::info
A URI will only be used to generate SPARQL queries if the question contains (up to stemming) the literal attached via one of the following properties:
- http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label
- http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title
- https://schema.org/name
- http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel
- http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel
:::

:::tip
If the literal has a language tag (like `@en`), it will only be searched in questions of that language. If no language tag is attached the corresponding label will be searched in questions of any language.
:::

For example for the following RDF graph:
```
PREFIX vsw: <http://vocabulary.semantic-web.at/cocktails>
PREFIX vswo: <http://vocabulary.semantic-web.at/cocktail-ontology>
PREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

vsw:2d85fb1b        rdfs:label "Margarita" ;
                    rdfs:label "Upside Down Margarita"@en .
vswo:consists-of    rdfs:label "consists of"@en ;
                    rdfs:label "contains"@en ;
                    rdfs:label "made up"@en ;
                    rdfs:label "ingredients"@en .
```
The URI `vsw:2d85fb1b` will only be used in a SPARQL query if the question either contains *"Margarita"* or *"Upside Down Margarita"*. <br/>
Moreover *"Margarita"* will be used for any language while *"Upside Down Margarita"* only for english questions.

The URI `vswo:consists-of` will be used to construct SPARQL queries if the question contains *"consists of"*, *"contains"*, *"made up"*, *"ingredients"* and **expressions that are equal to them up to stemming**. This is for example the case for the expression *"contained"* which, up to stemming, is the same as *"contains"*.

:::caution
Note that in particular for the graph:
```
vsw:Margarita   vswo:consists-of   vsw:Cointreau .
```

it will **not be possible to answer any question since no labels are attached**.
:::

Even if for humans the name of the URI is meaningfull, according to RDF standard the above graph is equivalent to:
```
vsw:2d85fb1b   vswo:1234   vsw:1439e6c3 .
```

## Reification

:::caution
In QAnswer we assume that the **RDF dataset does not use any form of reification**.
:::

To recall, RDF is perfectly suited to represent binary statements like: *"Margarita contains Cointreau"* which can be represented as the triple *(Margarita,contains, Cointreau)*.<br />
Reified statements are used when there is the need to speak about a binary statement like in: *"Margarita contains 50ml of Cointreau"*. In this case a triple is not enough to represent this piece of information. The Semantic Web Community proposed a series of models to represent these types of information. For a full overview of the presented models we refer to [this paper](https://www.emse.fr/~zimmermann/Papers/eswc2017b.pdf). One of the models is n-ary relations (the reification model used by Wikidata), where the knowledge would be represented as:
```
vsw:Margarita   vswo:consists-of_IN _:b1 .
_:b1 vswo:consists-of_OUT vsw:Cointreau .
vsw:blank vswo:quantity "50 ml" .
```

Another model is RDF reification which was , where the knowledge would be represented as:

```
vsw:Statement rdf:type rdf:Statement .
vsw:Statement rdf:subject vsw:Margarita .
vsw:Statement rdf:predicate vswo:consists-of .
vsw:Statement rdf:object vsw:Cointreau .
vsw:Statement vswo:quantity "50 ml" .
```
QAnswer was **not designed to cope with these representations** and it is not clear how it behaves when they are indexed in QAnswer.
