When uploading and indexing the data QAnswer also generated some additonal services. We describe them here briefly.

## Autocompletion

Once your data is uploaded you get out of the box autocompletion functionality. For example if you type on the cocktails dataset "marg" you will get:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/autocompletion.png' />

i.e. you get suggestions for "margarita" (the cocktail) and "margaglass" (a cocktail glass). By selecting one of the suggestions you will basicaly select the concept behind it, like:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/margaglass.png' />

By using it you will be able to search using strings and concepts.


As described in [Contextual information](contextual-information) you can indicate properties that are used to associate images to entities.
These properties will also be used to visualize images in the autosuggestion, like:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/autocompletion-image.png' />

Similarly if you specify a property that is used to disambiguate entities you will get autosugestions like:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/autocompletion-disambiguation.png' />

## SPARQL Endpoint

When indexing data in QAnswer you get a SPARQL 1.1 complient endpoint. The only limitation is that named graphs are not supported.

<p>
    You can ask SPARQL queries in the
    <span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>
        <img src='/img/icons/code.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
        <b style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#3d82b3', marginRight: '10px' }}>SPARQL Endpoint</b>
    </span>
    tab of the corresponding QA System. You can write this queries directly in SPARQL or write a natural language question and let QAnswer generate the SPARQL query for you.
</p>

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='a0' label='Default example'>
        <Admonition type='info'>When you first enter the page, there is a default example that you can run.</Admonition>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/sparql/empty.png' />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='a1' label='Ask text question'>
        <Admonition type='note'>The SPARQL query you see is the default one, once you validate your question (by pressing <i>Enter</i> or click the <i>Send</i> button) it will be updated.</Admonition>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/sparql/text-to-sparql.png' />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='a2' label='SPARQL query' default>
        Here you can see the generated SPARQL query for the question "Margarita ingredients". Then you can run the query to get the results.
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/sparql/margarita-ingredients.png' />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='a3' label='Result' >
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/sparql/margarita-ingredients-result.png' />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also write your own SPARQL query, for example:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/sparql/query.png' />

In this case we are asking over the cocktails dataset which are the most used ingredients.

## SPARQL to user

One service that is set up is SparqlToUser, a service that converts a SPARQL query to
a representation that is understandable by an end-user.

Concretly the service converts the SPARQL query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT ?s1 where { 
    ?s1 ?p1 <http://vocabulary.semantic-web.at/cocktail-ontology/Ingredients> .
    ?s1 ?p2 <http://vocabulary.semantic-web.at/cocktails/2d85fb1b-96cb-4c48-8df5-707032f34e71> . 
}
limit 1000
```
 
to the more user friendly representation:

```
type / Ingredients
 / is part of, is used by / Margarita
```

This service is used to display what the QA system understood:

or to facilitate the understanding of the generated interpretations:
