Each time you ask a question, the system tries to find best answers together with its confidence scores. The answers presented are ordered descendingly by confidence scores.

:::caution
Our backend model is evolving over time so the answers that you get might be different.

If you have questions you can [contact us](mailto:info@the-qa-company.com).

## Giving feedbacks

<div>
    <Admonition type="tip">
      <p>
        By using the feedback functionality, i.e. by clicking on either
        <img src='/img/icons/thumb_up.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
        or
        <img src='/img/icons/thumb_down.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
        or by <b>selecting yourself</b> the right answer, the system can learn better to answer your questions.
      </p>
    </Admonition>
</div>

When asking "Who are the parents of Homer Simpson?" after creation of the QA system, the system is not able to find the correct answers for you. <br/>
So we will have to collect some feedbacks to teach the AI what's the better answer for this question.

You can then see that the results changed.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="q1" label="Giving feedbacks" default>
    <p>
      The first extractive answer (we do not consider the Summarized Answer here) is wrong but the second one is correct. So we give a 
      <img src='/img/icons/thumb_up.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
      to the second answer and a 
      <img src='/img/icons/thumb_down.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
      to the first one.
    </p>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/who-are-parents-of-homer-before.png' alt='Who are the parents of Homer Simpson?'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q3" label="After training" default>
    After training the system, the first answer is now correct.
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/who-are-parents-of-homer-after.png' alt='Who are the parents of Homer Simpson?'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<div>
    <Admonition type="info">
    If the answer is wrong or incomplete but the right answer is in the same context, you can select it using the selectionning tool:
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
        <img src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/select-tool.png' alt='download' width='200px'/>
    </div>
    By default this tool is enabled so you just have to select the right answer.
    </Admonition>
</div>


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='q1' label='Select right answer' default>
    The given answer to the question: <i>"Who are Bart's siblings?"</i> is <i>"Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie"</i>, which is wrong.
    
    Using the <b>selectionning tool</b> we indicate manually the right answer which is: <i>"Lisa and Maggie"</i>.
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/bart-siblings-select.png' alt="Who are Bart's siblings?"/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='q2' label='Validate' default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/bart-siblings-validate.png' alt="Who are Bart's siblings?"/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

By collecting feedbacks, you are improving the AI models behind your QA systems. Theoritically, the more feedbacks you give, the smarter your QA system will be.

:::tip
Give a negative feedback if the answer is **not correct** AND if the real answer is **not in the context**. Otherwise select the right answer using the tool between the thumbs icons.

## Training

<p>
  You can access the <b>Training</b> page using the button in the status bar (on top of your screen) or in the <b>QA Systems</b> page by clicking on the QA system you are interested in and then the
  <span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>
    <img src='/img/icons/school.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
    <b style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#3d82b3', marginRight: '10px' }}>Training</b>
  </span>
  button.
</p>

<ImageGrid
    images={[
        {
            src: '/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/status-bar-train.png',
            alt: 'training button',
        }, {
            src: '/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/qa-system-training-btn.png',
            alt: 'training button',
        }
    ]}

This page allows you to see the feedbacks corresponding to your QA system. If you did not give feedbacks yet, a training set for the simpsons dataset can be downloaded here:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <Link
        target='_blank'
        to='/simpson_train.jsonl'
        download
        className="button button--primary button--lg"
    >
        Download training set üç©
    </Link>
</div>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="q2" label="No feedbacks yet">
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/training-empty.png' alt='new feedbacks'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='q1' label='You already have some feedbacks' default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/training.png' alt='existing feedbacks'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
Your feedbacks are displayed using a color code:
- Green: you gave üëç and the system was correct
- Red: you gave üëç but the system was incorrect
- Grey: you gave üëé
:::

<div>
    <Admonition type="tip">
    <p>To start training your system, you can click on the <i>Train</i> button.</p>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
      <img src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/train-btn.png' alt='training button' width= '300px'/>
    </div>
    The training process can take a few seconds depending on the size of your training set.
    </Admonition>
</div>

When your system is training, your page will look like this:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/training-animation.png' alt='Training animation' style={{ marginBottom: '20px'}} />

## Annotation

To use *Annotation mode* you can go on your **Training Page** and click on the *Annotate* button. 

The annotation mode allows you to give feedbacks on the system's answers, but also to search for an answer inside the document collection if the system did not find it.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="q1" label="Open annotation mode" default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/annotate.png' alt='annotate'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q3" label="Ask question" default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/annotate-instrument-lisa.png' alt='ask question'/>
    You can give feedbacks on these answers, the same way as you do in the <b>Ask page</b>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q4" label="Browse documents" default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/annotate-instrument-lisa-docs.png' alt='ask question'/>
    If you want to stop selecting text, you can click on the button next to the <i>Check system's answers</i> button.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


The feedbacks you give by selecting the answer inside the document collection will have as type "Annotated by user" so you can find them easily in the **Training Page**.

## Suggestions
When you enter one QA system, you can see the suggestions of the system. These suggestions are based on the questions you asked and the feedbacks you gave.
