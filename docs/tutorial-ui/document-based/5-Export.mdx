If you want to integrate the QA System into your own website, you can export it as a widget or bookmarklet. This allows you to provide instant question-answering capabilities to your website visitors. First, go to the <b>Export</b> page.

<p>
    You can access the <b>Export</b> page using the button in the status bar (on top of your screen) or in the <b>QA Systems</b> page by clicking on the QA system you are interested in and then the
    <span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>
        <img src='/img/icons/file_upload.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
        <b style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#3d82b3', marginRight: '10px' }}>Export</b>
    </span>
    button.
</p>

<ImageGrid
    images={[
        {
            src: '/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/document-based/export/status-bar.png',
            alt: 'Export page',
        }, {
            src: '/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/document-based/export/qasystem-export-button.png',
            alt: 'Export page',
        }
    ]}
    noTransformation
    templateColumns='repeat(1, 60%)'
    gap='5px'
/>

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/document-based/export/export-message.png' alt='Add message'/>

* **Theme**: choose the default theme for your widget. You can choose between: light, dark, auto. You will still be able to change the theme when using the widget. 

<ImageGrid images={[
  {
      src: '/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/document-based/export/light-theme.png',
      alt: 'Light theme',
      caption: 'Light theme',
  }, {
      src: '/img/screenshots/tutorial-ui/document-based/export/dark-theme.png',
      alt: 'Dark theme',
      caption: 'Dark theme',
  }]}
  noTransformation={true}
/>
