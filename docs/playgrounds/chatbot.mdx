## Edit message
<p>
    You can edit the message you sent by clicking on the
    <img src='/img/icons/edit_note.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} alt='edit' />
    icon that appears when you hover one of your messages (top-right corner of the message).
</p>

:::info
When you click *Apply changes* when editing a message, the chatbot will generate a new answer based on the edited message. The previous messages (questions and answers) will be kept in the chat history but the following ones will be deleted.
:::

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='q1' label='Ask'>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/playgrounds/chatbot/chat-movie.png' alt='Movies ideas'/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='q2' label='Edit' default>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/playgrounds/chatbot/chat-movie-edit-ui.png' alt='Edit message'/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='q3' label='Edited'>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/playgrounds/chatbot/chat-movie-edited-sci-fi.png' alt='New answer'/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
Sometimes the chatbot may not understand your question or may not be able to provide an answer. In this case, you can click on the *Edit* icon to edit your question and try to rephrase it or add more context.
:::

If the chatbot understood your question but the answer is not satisfactory, you can either edit your question to add more context or click on the *Re-generate answer* button (on top of the input field) to get a new answer.

## Re-generate answer

<p>
    If you get an answer that does not satisfy you, you can click
    <span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>
        <img src='/img/icons/replay_blue.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
        <b style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#3d82b3', marginRight: '10px' }}>Re-generate answer</b>
    </span>
    (on top of the input field) to get a new answer.
</p>

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='q1' label='Snack ideas' default>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/playgrounds/chatbot/chat-snacks-1.png' alt='Snack ideas'/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='q2' label='Re-generated'>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/playgrounds/chatbot/chat-snacks-2.png' alt='Snack ideas'/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>




## Continue conversation
Sometimes the chatbot may stop answering your question due to a character limit. In this case it will display an information message on which you can click to get the end of the answer.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='q1' label='Limit reached' default>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/playgrounds/chatbot/chat-movie-limit-reached.png' alt='Limit reached'/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='q2' label='Continue'>
        <Image src='/img/screenshots/playgrounds/chatbot/chat-movie-limit-reached-continue.png' alt='Continue answering'/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Clear chat
<p>
  You can click on the
  <span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>
    <img src='/img/icons/clear.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
    <b style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#3d82b3', marginRight: '10px' }}>Clear</b>
  </span>
  button (on top of the input field) to clear the chat history and start fresh.
</p>

You will get back to the initial state of the chatbot:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/playgrounds/chatbot/chat-empty.png' alt='Cleared chat'/>

## Stop generation

When the chatbot is answering your question, you can see it typing and generating the answer. If you want it to stop answering, you can click on the <b style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#3d82b3', marginRight: '10px' }}>Stop generation</b> button on top of the search bar.

<Image src='/img/screenshots/playgrounds/chatbot/stop-generating.png' alt='Stop generation'/>

## Corrections

When the chatbot does not understand your question, or does a mistake, instead of re-generating the answer or editing your question, you can also tell what's wrong and ask it to correct itself.

:::tip
When the chatbot is wrong, you can:
* add more context
* explain what's wrong
* ask it to correct itself
The chatbot will then try to correct itself and give you a better answer.
