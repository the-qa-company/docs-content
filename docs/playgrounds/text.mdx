The goal of this tutorial is to have fun using question answering over text! Let's construct your own digital twin!

It should be able to reply to questions about yourself like: 
* "What do you like?"
* "How old are you?"
* "What languages do you speak?"
* "Where do you live?"

and other things you would like him to know or not ðŸ˜‰

While you will create your digital twin, I will create mine ðŸ˜€ so we are also going to know each other better!

        Open text playground!

</div>

## Description

The playground is separated in two parts:
- **Left** is your *Context*: the text you want to ask questions about;
- **Right** is where you ask your questions: ask your question, its answer will appear below

You can use the *Example* text to try out the playground, modify it and see what happens or you can use your own text!

## Examples

Here are some questions you can ask:
1. Who developed you?
2. What do you like
3. What language do you speak?
4. In what languages are you coded?
5. Where do you live?

Don't hesitate to **try more questions**, modify the context and experiment with the playground!
