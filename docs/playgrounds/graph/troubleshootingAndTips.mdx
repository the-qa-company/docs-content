While writing down the Knwoledge Graph about myself, and asking questions, I noted that there were some problems, mainly two things happened:
* The Knowledge is not encoded correctly
* The interpretation is wrong

Maybe the same happend to you, so let's see what we can do! 

## The Knowledge is not encoded correctly

At some point for example I wrote:

```
qa:birthPlace rdfs:label "born" .
qa:birthPlace skos:altLabel "birth place" .

#create node Saint-Etienne
qa:saintEtienne rdfs:label "Saint-Etienne" .

#born in Saint-Etienne
qa:node2 qa:birthPlace qa:saintEtienne . 
```


Do you see the error? The problem is the last triple, instead of writing
```
#born in Saint-Etienne
qa:node1 qa:birthPlace qa:saintEtienne . 
```


i.e. that QAnswer was born in Saint-Etienne, I wrote
```
#born in Saint-Etienne
qa:node2 qa:birthPlace qa:saintEtienne . 
```


i.e. that English was born in Saint-Etienne. So clearly we will not get a meaningful answer if
the knowledge is not encoded correctly. So one important thing is: "Check that your knowledge is encoded correctly!"


## The interpretation is wrong
The second thing that happened was that some questions where interpreted wrongly even if the knowledge was encoded
correctly. When I asked "Where are you born?"
I got:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/playground-graph/where-born-wrong-interpretation.png' alt='where are you born' />

But I asked "where", not "when"! and the information in the Knowledge Graph was correct!
In this case when I clicked on <i>show other SPARQL interpretations</i> (on the left of the current interpretation).

<ImageGrid
    images={[
        {
            src: '/img/screenshots/playground-graph/born-at-interpretations-btn.png',
            alt: 'show more interpretations',
            caption: 'Click to show more interpretations',
        }, {
            src: '/img/screenshots/playground-graph/born-at-interpretations-open.png',
            alt: 'hide interpretation',
            caption: 'Click to hide interpretations',
        }
    ]}
    noTransformation
    templateColumns='repeat(2, 1fr)'
    gap='30px'
    gridMaxWidth='600px'
/>

I found the right interpretation:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/playground-graph/where-born-sparql-interpretations.png' alt='interpretations' />

You see it, it is the 2nd one! When I clicked on it I got the right answer:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/playground-graph/where-born.png' alt='where are you born' />

## Save your content to a file

:::caution
This is a playground so **it will not be saved**.
:::

<div>
    <Admonition type="tip">
    <p>If you want to save it anyway you can <b>download your file</b> by clicking on the <i>download</i> icon of the editor.</p>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
        <img src='/img/screenshots/playground-graph/download-playground.png' alt='download' width='200px'/>
    </div>
    <p>Then you can use this file to <b>create a QA system</b>.</p>
    </Admonition>
</div>

Let's see now how to construct a full [QA System over an RDF Graph!](/tutorial-ui/rdf-based/rdf-to-qa)
