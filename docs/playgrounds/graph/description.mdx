The goal of this tutorial is to construct your own digital twin!

It should be able to reply to questions about yourself like: 
* "Where were you born?"
* "What do you like to eat?"
* "Who is your best friend?"
* "What languages do you speak?"

and other things you would like him to know or not ðŸ˜‰

While you will create your digital twin, I will create mine ðŸ˜€ so we are also going to know each other better!

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <Link
        to='https://app.qanswer.ai/playground/kg'
        className="button button--primary button--lg"
        style={{ textDecoration: 'none', backgroundColor: 'var(--ifm-color-blush-light)', color: '#000', border: 'none' }}

The playground is separated in two parts:
- **Left** is your *Context*: the turtle code you want to ask questions on
- **Right** is where you ask your questions: ask your question, the answers will appear below with the display types available

    <p>If you want to save it anyway you can <b>download your file</b> by clicking on the <i>download</i> icon of the editor.</p>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
        <img src='/img/screenshots/playground-graph/download-playground.png' alt='download' width='200px'/>
