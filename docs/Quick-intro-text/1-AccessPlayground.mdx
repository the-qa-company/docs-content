The goal of this tutorial is to have fun using question answering over text! Let's construct your own digital twin!

It should be able to reply to questions about yourself like: 
* "What do you like?"
* "How old are you?"
* "What languages do you speak?"
* "Where do you live?"

and other things you would like him to know or not ðŸ˜‰

While you will create your digital twin, I will create mine ðŸ˜€ so we are also going to know each other better ....
