There is a text-field named *Context*, you can write your text in here. <br/>Then you can ask your questions!

If you are shy follow my lead ðŸ˜‰

For each answer you can see the answer (here *QAnswer*) the question asked (here *Who are you?*) and the confidence score associated to this answer.

Let's write a bit more text and see what we can get!

As you can see, you have an history of the questions you asked, you can scroll to see the previous questions and answers.

Here is the text I used for this example:
```
Hi,
Iâ€™m QAnswer, a platform to create question answering systems over proprietary datasets!
Iâ€™m developed by The QA Company. I personally like AI, user friendly interfaces and Question Answering (QA) Technologies.
Iâ€™m 3 years old, but I started to understand unstructured data just this year!
Currently I understand only English, but my developers are working to support many other languages, some of which you probably are not able to understand.
How do I work? My internals are pretty complicated, what I can say is that Iâ€™m written in Python, Java and Typescript. Some information retrieval and some neuronal networks are running behind the scenes. All to answer the questions that you ask!
I like to eat your questions, one after the other. I cannot listen to music but I can hear the bits that are moved around on this server.
I'm living on a server, somewhere on planet Earth.

```
