We have seen in the previous section which is the relation between your RDF data and the questions you can answer with it.
To index your RDF dataset you need to signup to the QAnswer platform. This can be done using the following code snippets:


  ```bash 
    curl -X POST \
      'https://app.qanswer.ai/api/user/signup' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"name": "NAME", "email":"EMAIL", "username":"USERNAME", "password":"PASSWORD"}'
  ```

After you will directly be able to login. This can be done using the following code snippets:


  ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      'https://app.qanswer.ai/api/user/signin' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"usernameOrEmail": "USERNAME", "password":"PASSWORD"}'
  ```


After logging in you will get a Bearer token that you have to use for all subsequent calls to identify with respect to the service.
