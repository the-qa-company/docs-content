While writing down the Knwoledge Graph about myself, and asking questions, I noted that there were some problems. 
Maybe the same happend to you! 

Mainly two things happened ...

## 1. The Knowledge is not encoded correctly

At some point for example I wrote:

```
qa:birthPlace rdfs:label "born" .
qa:birthPlace skos:altLabel "birth place" .

#create node Saint-Etienne
qa:saintEtienne rdfs:label "Saint-Etienne" .

#born in Saint-Etienne
qa:node2 qa:birthPlace qa:saintEtienne . 
```


Do you see the error? The problem is the last triple, instead of writing
```
#born in Saint-Etienne
qa:node1 qa:birthPlace qa:saintEtienne . 
```


i.e. that QAnswer was born in Saint-Etienne, I wrote
```
#born in Saint-Etienne
qa:node2 qa:birthPlace qa:saintEtienne . 
```


i.e. that English was born in Saint-Etienne. So clearly we will not get a meaningful answer if
the knowledge is not encoded correctly. So one important thing is: "Check that your knowledge is encoded correctly!"


## 2. The interpretation is wrong
The second thing that happened was that some questions where interpreted wrongly even if the knowledge was encoded
correctly. When I asked "Where are you born?"
I got:

<Image src='/img/newUI/wrong-interpretation.png' alt='where are you born' />

But I asked "where", not "when"! and the information in the Knowledge Graph was correct!
In this case when I clicked on <i>show other SPARQL interpretations</i> (on the left of the current interpretation) I found the right interpretation:

<Image src='/img/newUI/wrong-interpretation-sparqllist.png' alt='where are you born' />

You see it, it is the 2nd one! When I clicked on it I got the right answer:

<Image src='/img/newUI/wrong-interpretation-found-good-one.png' alt='where are you born' />

It is important at this step to tell that this is the right interpretation, not the previous one! So
I clicked on the thumb-up icon. It is good to do that because you create a training
data set, and the quality of the answers get better. I always do it! When I click on <b>Training Evaluation</b>
I can see all things I asked:

<Image src='/img/newUI/before-training.png' alt='Before training' />


:::info
In green are the good answers, in red are the bad answers.

Bad answers are the ones for which :
1. the answer was incorrect.
2. the answer was correct but the confidence was lesser than 50%.

        You can click on <b>Train</b> to train the model so it gets more accurate.

Cool now all questions are answered correctly, and when I ask:

<Image src='/img/newUI/successful-training.png' alt='Right answer!' />


I get the right answer. 

:::note
1. The algorithm didn't see this before, it generallized!
2. In this KG there are 6 relations and you will need around 20 training examples
:::

:::caution
In production, there will be <i>No Answer</i> if the confidence of the QA system is lesser than 50% for the corresponding question.

Now, let's learn a bit more how to use the UI...
