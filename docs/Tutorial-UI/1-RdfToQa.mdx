The key requirement for QAnswer is the RDF model that you provide for indexing. RDF is a flexible data model and can be used in many different ways. QAnswer
tries to make the weakest assumptions possible on the RDF dataset it can query.

:::info
In this tutorial we are going to make a Question Answering (QA) system on top of a cocktail KB that can be found [here 🍸](/cocktails.nt).
:::

Here are some lines
extracted from the cocktail KB and describing a cocktail called *Margarita* or *Upside Down Margarita*. Moreover the snippet contains the information that the
cocktails contains *Cointreau*, *Tequila* and *Lime juice*:

This RDF snippet would allow to answer the following questions:

```
- What are the ingredients of Margarita? -> Cointreau, Tequila, Lime juice
- What is Margarita made of? -> Cointreau, Tequilla, Lime juice
- The ingredients of Margarita are what? -> Cointreau, Tequila, Lime juice
- ingredients margarita? -> Cointreau, Tequila, Lime juice
- What is Margarita? -> The margarita is a Mexican cocktail consisting of tequila mixed with Cointreau or similar orange-flavoured liqueur and lime or lemon juice, often served with salt on the glass rim.
