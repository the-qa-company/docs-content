You can share your QA Systems with others, they will be able to ask questions and give feedbacks too!

Let me show you how!


## Configuration

First you need to go to the Configuration page.

You can access it using the button in the status bar (on top of you screen) or in the QA Systems page by clicking on the QA system you are interested in and then the Config button.


<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '10px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <img src='/img/newUI/share-option/status-bar-config-btn.png' alt='Config button' width= '60%'/>
    <img src='/img/newUI/share-option/qa-system-config-btn.png' alt='Config button' width= '60%'/>
</div>

Here is where you can configure your QA System. In the *Access* section you can enable the share option.

:::tip
Share your link to others so they can ask questions to your QA System and give feedbacks!
:::

## Shared mode

This is the view that others will see when they open your shared link.



<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='s1' label='Ask page' default>
        <Image src='/img/newUI/share-option/shared-mode-ask-cocktails.png' alt='Ask page'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='s2' label='Answer page'>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/share-option/shared-mode-cocktails-with-lime.png' alt='Ask page'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Only the QA System's owner can acces the QA System's configs or Training page. But those who use the link can still help by giving feedbacks.
:::

:::info
On the Training page the owner will see all the feedbacks given to his QA System and the question log.
:::

To differentiate the feedbacks/questions given by the owner and the ones given by others, you can use the **Trusted** column, the **owner's** feedbacks/questions are set at **true**.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='s1' label='Trusted feedback' default>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='s2' label='Trusted question log'>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/share-option/question-log-trusted.png' alt='Ask page'/>
  </TabItem>
