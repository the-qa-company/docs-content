As you can see on your home page (next to *My QA Systems* title), there is a quota for the number of QA Systems based on graphs. 
It's **default value is 5**. It can be changed by an administrator.

:::note
Playgrounds are counted in your number of QA Systems
:::

If you have reached the quota, you will not be able to create new QA Systems. You can delete existing QA Systems to create new ones.

You can also see that quota in your profile page.

There is another quota for the size of the file you import. The **default value is 5MB**. It can also be changed by an administrator.
