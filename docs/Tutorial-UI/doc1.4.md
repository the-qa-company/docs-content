and

Note that for now there is no contextual information attached to the answers, like labels, descriptions, external links, maps, images and videos. How this can be achieved
will be shown in [Part 6](/docs/doc1.6).

The dataset contains some popular cocktails like: Margarita, Sex on the Beach, Long Island Iced Tea and Grasshopper.

The results that you achieve may not be satisfying. To train the machine learning model to fit your dataset check the next section.
