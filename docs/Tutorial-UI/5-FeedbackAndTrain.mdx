## Feedback

Each time you ask a question the system generate interpretations and computes a confidence score. A list of different interpretations can be shown by clicking on the button at the left of the current interpretation.
:::note
The confidence is shown in the bar under the interpretation. The system believes the answer is correct if the confidence is bigger than 50% and wrong if it is lower than 50%.
:::
By using the feedback functionality, i.e. by clicking on either the thumbs-up üëç or thumb-down üëé, the system can learn to choose the right interpretation
and correctly compute the confidence.

When asking "What is a cocktail" as a response a list of all cocktails is given, i.e. the system understood that we search for anything of type cocktail which would correspond to "Give me all cocktails".

<p>
  You can click on the "SPARQL interpretation" icon:
  <img src='/img/icons/change_circle.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
  (at the left of the current interpretation) all generated interpretations will be shown:
</p>

In particular the second returns general information about "Cocktail". This is the interpretation we are searching for. By clicking on this interpretation we get:

<Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/cocktail.png' alt='SPARQL list'/>

Which gives general information about "Cocktail". By using the feedback functionality (i.e. üëç or üëé), the system will save the given example.

After asking a set of questions, and by giving feedback you will have created a training set. A training set for the cocktail dataset can be downloaded here:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <Link
        target='_blank'
        to='pathname:///questions_cocktail.json'
        className="button button--primary button--lg"
    >
        Download training set üç∏
    </Link>
</div>

## Training

First you need to access the **Training** page.

You can access it page using the button in the status bar (on top of you screen) or in the **QA Systems** page by clicking on the QA system you are interested in and then the *Training* button.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '10px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <img src='/img/newUI/cocktails/status-bar.png' alt='training button' width= '60%'/>
    <img src='/img/newUI/cocktails/qa-system-training-btn.png' alt='training button' width= '60%'/>
</div>

It can be uploaded from the [training page](https://app.qanswer.ai/qa-systems/training) using the "Upload Train" button (available either if you already have feedbacks or not).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="q2" label="No feedbacks yet">
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/training-upload.png' alt='new feedbacks'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='q1' label='You already have some feedbacks' default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/training-add-to-existing.png' alt='existing feedbacks'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

On this page you have an overview of how the system performs on the questions you gave feedbacks and some statistics. You can also see a tab name [Logs](#logs) which will show you the history of questions asked.

<Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/training-upload-done.png' alt='before training'/>

After clicking on *Train* the system will create a model that adapts to your dataset:

<Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/after-training.png' alt='after training' />

:::note
The model will generalize also over questions you didn't ask.
:::

Now you learned how to give feedbacks to the system and how these feedbacks can be used to adapt QAnswer to your QA Systems.

## Logs

This tab is used to see a list of all questions that have been asked to this QA System.
