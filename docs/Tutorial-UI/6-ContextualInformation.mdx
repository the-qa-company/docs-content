Up to now the result was always given by the "rdfs:label". But in an RDF dataset there are potentially many contextual information that can be shown like
descriptions, images, maps and videos.

To allow QAnswer to display this contextual information your ontology vocabulary has to be aligned by the one used by
QAnswer. This is necessary since there are different proposed vocabulary to express this type of information in the Semantic Web Community and no one became
a standard. QAnswer is using some common properties. So let's start.

In the case of the cocktail Knowledge Base you can add the following properties:

1. Description: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition>
2. Image: <http://vocabulary.semantic-web.at/cocktail-ontology/image>
3. Dbpedia: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#exactMatch>

To do that you need to go to the **UI Mapping** page accessible [here](https://app.qanswer.ai/qa-systems/uimapping)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='b' label='Before'>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/desc-img-before.png' alt='before'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="a" label="After" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/desc-img-after.png' alt='after'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

It will be automatically saved but you can also click the save button if you want to.

The properties are then used to show the contextual information which will influence the way the answers are displayed.

Thanks to the *Image* property we added, we unlocked a **new way to display answers** the *Images* one (depending on what we ask). So we can visualiza an answer as a grid of images, we can click on each element to have more detail on it.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='b1' label='Before'>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/before-adding-img-mapping.png' alt='before'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="a1" label="After" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/after-adding-img-mapping.png' alt='after'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Thanks to the new *Description* and *Image* properties, in the *List* display, we can see the description and an image of the cocktail.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='b2' label='Before'>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/before-adding-img-dsc.png' alt='before'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="a2" label="After" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/after-adding-img-dsc.png' alt='after'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
