For "The Simpsons" QA system, you can ask questions like:
- "who are the children of the simpsons"
- "what is the name of the dog of the simpsons"

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='q1' label='Question 1' default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/who-are-the-children.png' alt='who are the children of the simpsons'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q2" label="Question 2">
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/what-is-name-of-dog.png' alt='what is the name of the dog of the simpsons'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When the system gives you an answer it is underlined inside its context. You can also see in which document it was found (on the top-left corner).

You can click on the *Open PDF* button, it will show you the answer underline in the PDF document.
