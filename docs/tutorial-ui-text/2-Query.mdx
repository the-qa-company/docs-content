  icon, you will enter the QA system built on top of the documents you uploaded.

You can also switch to another QA system using the selector located at the top right corner.

For "The Simpsons" QA system, you can ask questions like:
- "who are the children of the simpsons"
- "what is the name of the dog of the simpsons"

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='q1' label='Question 1' default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/who-are-the-children.png' alt='who are the children of the simpsons'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q2" label="Question 2">
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/what-is-name-of-dog.png' alt='what is the name of the dog of the simpsons'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When the system gives you an answer it is highlighted inside its context. You can also see in which document it was found (at the beginning of the box).

<p>
  You can click on the
  <b style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#666666', marginLeft: '10px' }}>Open PDF</b>
  <img src='/img/icons/open_in_new.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
  button (at the bottom right), it will show you the answer highlighted in the PDF document.

Sometimes the AI model we put by default may not fit in your situation and as a result
you see bad answers presented by the system.
To solve this problem, check the [train](feedback-train) section to adapt the model for your specific
use!
