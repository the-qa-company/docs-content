For "The Simpsons" QA system, you can ask questions like:
- "who are the children of the simpsons"
- "what is the name of the dog of the simpsons"


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='q1' label='Question 1' default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/who-are-the-children.png' alt='who are the children of the simpsons'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='q2' label='Question 2'>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-text/what-is-name-of-dog.png' alt='what is the name of the dog of the simpsons'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

    <Admonition type="tip">
      <p>
        The summarized answer is a synthesized answer based on all the answers and documents QAnswer has found.
        The answer is based on a generative model, therefore each generated answer could be in different wording by will always try to deliver the some information. You can trigger re-summarise function by click on
        <img src='/img/icons/replay.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
        icon. <br/>
        To further improve the summariser, you can always give feedback by clicking on
        <img src='/img/icons/thumb_up.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
        or
        <img src='/img/icons/thumb_down.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
        .
      </p>
    </Admonition>
</div>

When the system gives you an answer it is highlighted inside its context. You can also see in which document it was found (at the beginning of the box).

<p>
  You can click on the
  <span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>
    <b style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#666666', marginLeft: '10px' }}>Open PDF</b>
    <img src='/img/icons/open_in_new.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
  </span>
  button (at the bottom right), it will show you the answer highlighted in the PDF document.

Sometimes the AI model we put by default may not fit in your situation and as a result
you see bad answers presented by the system.
To solve this problem, check the [train](feedback-train) section to adapt the model for your specific
use!

:::caution
Our backend model is evolving over time so the answers that you get might be different.
