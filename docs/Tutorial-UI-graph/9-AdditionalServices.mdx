When uploading and indexing the data QAnswer also generated some additonal services. We describe them here briefly.

## Autocompletion

Once your data is uploaded you get out of the box autocompletion functionality. For example if you type on the cocktails dataset "marg" you will get:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/autocompletion.png' />

i.e. you get suggestions for "margarita" (the cocktail) and "margaglass" (a cocktail glass). By selecting one of the suggestions you will basicaly select the concept behind it, like:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/margaglass.png' />

By using it you will be able to search using strings and concepts.


As described in [Contextual information](contextual-information) you can indicate properties that are used to associate images to entities.
These properties will also be used to visualize images in the autosuggestion, like:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/autocompletion-image.png' />

Similarly if you specify a property that is used to disambiguate entities you will get autosugestions like:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/autocompletion-disambiguation.png' />

## SPARQL Endpoint

When indexing data in QAnswer you get a SPARQL 1.1 complient endpoint. The only limitation is that named graphs are not supported.
You can ask SPARQL queries in the "SPARQL Endpoint" tab of the corresponding dataset:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/sparql.png' />

In this case we are asking over the cocktails dataset which are the most used ingredients.

## SparqlToUser

One service that is set up is SparqlToUser, a service that converts a SPARQL query to
a representation that is understandable by an end-user.

Concretly the service converts the SPARQL query:

```
SELECT DISTINCT ?s1 where { 
    ?s1 ?p1 <http://vocabulary.semantic-web.at/cocktail-ontology/Ingredients> .
    ?s1 ?p2 <http://vocabulary.semantic-web.at/cocktails/2d85fb1b-96cb-4c48-8df5-707032f34e71> . 
}
limit 1000
```
 
to the more user friendly representation:

```
type / Ingredients
 / is part of, is used by / Margarita
```

This service is used to display what the QA system understood:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/interpretation-margarita.png' />

or to facilitate the understanding of the generated interpretations:
