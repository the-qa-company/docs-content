## Feedback

Each time you ask a question the system generate interpretations and computes a confidence score. A list of different interpretations can be shown by clicking on the button at the left of the current interpretation.
:::note
The confidence is shown in the bar under the interpretation. The system believes the answer is correct if the confidence is bigger than 50% and wrong if it is lower than 50%.
:::
By using the feedback functionality, i.e. by clicking on either the thumbs-up üëç or thumb-down üëé, the system can learn to choose the right interpretation
and correctly compute the confidence.

When asking "What is a cocktail" as a response a list of all cocktails is given, i.e. the system understood that we search for anything of type cocktail which would correspond to "Give me all cocktails".

<p>
  You can click on the "SPARQL interpretation" icon:
  <img src='/img/icons/change_circle.svg' style={{ width: '30px', padding: '0 5px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}/>
  (at the left of the current interpretation) all generated interpretations will be shown:
</p>

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/what-is-a-cocktail-sparqllist.png' alt='SPARQL list'/>

In particular the second returns general information about "Cocktail". This is the interpretation we are searching for. By clicking on this interpretation we get:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/cocktail.png' alt='right answer'/>

Which gives general information about "Cocktail". By using the feedback functionality (i.e. üëç or üëé), the system will save the given example.

After asking a set of questions, and by giving feedback you will have created a training set. A training set for the cocktail dataset can be downloaded here:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <Link
        target='_blank'
        to='/questions_cocktail.json'
        download
        className="button button--primary button--lg"
    >
        Download training set üç∏
    </Link>
</div>

## Training

First you need to access the **Training** page.

You can access it using the button in the status bar (on top of you screen) or in the **QA Systems** page by clicking on the QA system you are interested in and then the *Training* button.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '10px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <img src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/status-bar.png' alt='training button' width= '60%'/>
    <img src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/qa-system-training-btn.png' alt='training button' width= '60%'/>
</div>

It can be uploaded from the [training page](https://app.qanswer.ai/qa-systems/training) using the "Upload Train" button (available either if you already have feedbacks or not).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="q2" label="No feedbacks yet">
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/training-empty.png' alt='new feedbacks'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='q1' label='You already have some feedbacks' default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/training-existing.png' alt='existing feedbacks'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

On this page you have an overview of how the system performs on the questions you gave feedbacks and some statistics. You can also see a tab name [Logs](#logs) which will show you the history of questions asked.

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/training-upload-done.png' alt='before training'/>

After clicking on *Train* the system will create a model that adapts to your dataset:

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/trained.png' alt='after training' />

:::note
The model will generalize also over questions you didn't ask.
:::

Now you learned how to give feedbacks to the system and how these feedbacks can be used to adapt QAnswer to your QA Systems.

## Logs

This tab is used to see a list of all questions that have been asked to this QA System.

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/logs.png' alt='logs' />


## Sharing

Let's share the QA System with other users, here **userB** with read rights and **userC** with write rights.
More information about sharing can be found [here](/share).

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/share.png' alt='share' />

These users can now access the QA System and give feedbacks to the system. As you can notice on the *Training page*.

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/share.png' alt='share' />

:::note
You can see who gave the feedbacks in the *Feedbacks* tab. And also see the history of questions asked in the *Logs* tab to know who asked what.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='f' label='Feedbacks' default>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/feedbacks-shared.png' alt='feedbacks'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='l' label='Logs'>
    <Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/logs-shared.png' alt='logs'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
You can filter your feedbacks and log depending on a column value. 
:::

Let's add a filter related to users, click on the three-dot icon to open the menu:
<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '10px', marginBottom: '20px', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <img src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/filter-menu.png' alt='nav bar' style={{ height: '300px' }}/>
</div>

Let's use the *Filter* option to filter the feedbacks by user.

<Image src='/img/screenshots/tuto-ui-graph/filtered-user.png' alt='filter by username'/>

You can filter in various ways and adapt the filters to your needs.
