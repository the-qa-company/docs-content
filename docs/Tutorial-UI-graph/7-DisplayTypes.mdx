Depending on the answer we get, we can display it in different ways. The types available are listed below the confidence bar on the answer page, for example:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '10px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
    <img src='/img/newUI/display-types/display-types.png' alt='display types' width='40%'/>
</div>

You can personnalize the visualization order in the [Configuration page](https://app.qanswer.ai/qa-systems/config), which means that you can order the display types depending on what you want. You can drag and drop the items of the list to order them differently and also hide some display types using the eye icon.

## Facet
Facet is the default display type. It allows you to see all the properties of an element.<br/>
When the answer is a single element, it is expanded by default.<br/>
When the answer is composed of several elements, these elements are listed and you can click on them to expand them and see more detail.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="f1" label="One element" default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/display-types/facet-margarita.png' alt='margarita'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='f2' label='List of elements'>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/display-types/facet-margarita-ingredients.png' alt='margarita ingredients'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='f3' label='List of elements > expand element'>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/display-types/facet-margarita-ingredients-lime.png' alt='margarita ingredients > lime'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## List
*List* is similar to *Facet*, the difference is that not all properties of an element are displayed, only some information that is judged important, like the description or the image.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="ðŸš§" title="Some changes will be made on that display type."/>

## Images
*Images* allows you to visualize your answer as a grid of images. If you want more information on an element you can click on it and it will redirect you to this element (using *Facet* display to see all information available).

## Simple
*Simple* is like is name says, a simple way to display information. It is a table constitued of 2 columns. In the example below, we asked for "all cocktails ingredients" so on the first column we see cocktails name, and on the other columns, ingredients that constitute these cocktails.
