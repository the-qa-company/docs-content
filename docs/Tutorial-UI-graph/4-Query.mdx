For the "Cocktails" QA system you could ask for example: "What is a Margarita?" or "What are the ingredients of Margarita?":


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='q1' label='Question 1' default>
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/margarita.png' alt='margarita'/>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="q2" label="Question 2">
    <Image src='/img/newUI/cocktails/margarita-ingredients.png' alt='margarita ingredients'/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
