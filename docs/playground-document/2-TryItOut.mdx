The playground is separated in two parts:
- **Left** is your *Context*: the pdf you want to ask questions about;
- **Right** is where you ask your questions: ask your question, its answer will appear below


For this example we will use a pdf about *Lisa Simpson* coming from [the Simpsons Wiki](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Simpson_family).

<Image src='/img/screenshots/playground-document/playground-lisa-doc.png' alt='QA Systems'/>

Here are some questions you can ask:
1. How old is Lisa?
2. Lisa's hobbies
3. Is Lisa a member of an organisation?
4. Which languages does Lisa speak?
5. What is Lisa passionate about?

Don't hesitate to **try more questions**, and try other pdf to experiment with the playground!
