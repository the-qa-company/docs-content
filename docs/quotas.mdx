As you can see on your home page (on top of *My QA Systems* title), there are quotas for the number of QA Systems based on graph and text. 
Both of these quotas' **default value is 5**. It can be changed by an administrator.

:::info
Shared QA Systems are not counted in the quotas.
:::

If you have reached your quota, you will not be able to create new QA Systems. You can delete existing QA Systems (of the corresponding type: graph/text) to create new ones.

You can also see these quotas on your profile page.

There are other quotas for the size of the files you import. The **default value is 5MB**. It can also be changed by an administrator.

For text-based QA Systems, since we can add several files, we want the collection size to be less than the quota. For example, if the quota is 5MB, we can add 5 files of 1MB each, or 1 file of 5MB. 

When you create your QA System, you can see the size of each files and chose accordingly which files you want to add/remove.
