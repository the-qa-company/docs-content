The goal of this tutorial is to construct your own digital twin!

It should be able to reply to questions about yourself like: 
* "Where were you born?"
* "What do you like to eat?"
* "Who is your best friend?"
* "What languages do you speak?"

and other things you would like him to know or not ðŸ˜‰

While you will create your digital twin, I will create mine ðŸ˜€ so we are also going to know each other better ....
