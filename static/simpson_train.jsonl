He is sometimes called El Barto.\u201d\nBiography\nBart is a self-proclaimed underachiever and prankster who is constantly in detention, and, in addition to\nhis behavior, is easily distracted. He is the most misunderstood of the family (after Maggie, who currently\ncan only speak a few words), constantly frustrated by the narrow-minded people of Springfield, who\njudge him merely by his thoughts and actions.\nHis penchant for shocking people began before he was born, Bart \"mooned\" Dr. Hibbert while he\nperformed a sonogram on Marge when she was pregnant with him, and moments after being born, he\nset Homer's tie-on fire, starting his life as a prankster (although Marge claimed that he could not have\fdone it on purpose because he was only ten minutes old)[11]. Bart's first words were \"Ay Caramba\"[12"}

On one\noccasion, Homer has misinterpreted a threat about losing his job as a hint that he can take the following\nday off.\nHomer also applied for a job as Santa, to make up for his missed Christmas bonus at the power plant.[54]\nCriminal Record\fHomer has committed a wide range of crimes and infractions, from ticket-worthy offenses to felonies.\nHe's spent little time in jail for his actions, but if he were to be found guilty of all the counts detailed\nbelow, he could find himself"}

Though the two are close friends, Bart has\naccidentally put Milhouse into trouble countless times throughout the series, with more than one\noccasion causing physical harm to Milhouse due to Bart's lack of regard for Milhouse's safety.

When\nMarge stopped Bart from driving the forklift, Milhouse was sent flying and was knocked unconscious.\nThe relationship between Milhouse and Bart has been strained several times.
