In a series of interviews in 1990, Groening reportedly stated that he named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day of the Locust, a 1939 novel by Nathanael West according to Planet Simpson, but neither explanation is considered definitive. Biography Homer Jay Simpson was born on May 12, 1956, to Abraham Simpson II and Mona Olsen. He was raised on the Simpson family farm until they were forced to move out due to Homer jumping out of a hay bale and scaring the cows into giving sour milk, causing the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer began drinking alcohol like his father and accidentally caused a traffic jam in a Playskool car. According to a family tree designed by the creator of the show, Matt Groening, Mr. Burns, his boss, is a distant relative of him. His father forced him to attend Camp See-A-Tree, where he went on a date with Marge Bouvier from Camp Land-A-Man; unfortunately, he lied about his name and sustained an injury while Marge changed her appearance.

Despite his behavior, Bart is also extremely good at science, art and even sports like skateboarding.

When Bart became a hall monitor for Springfield Elementary, his grades went up, showing that he only struggles because he does not pay any attention. [15] Bart has ADHD.

On the other hand, Bart often seems to have trouble understanding even the simplest concepts, such as the word \"irony,\" what the equator is and that the logo on his globe (\"Rand McNally\") is not actually a country. It was also once implied that his mischievous behavior may have been a result of Marge accidentally ingesting a droplet of champagne while pregnant with him.
