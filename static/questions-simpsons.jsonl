His other catchphrases included \"\u00a1Ay, caramba!\" and \"Don't have a cow man!\" - the former being his first words after seeing Homer and Marge 'enjoying themselves' in bed - but these dropped out of use as the series progressed (as mentioned in \"Summer of 4 Ft. 2\", when Bart complains that Lisa stole his line).

After a slight consideration, Homer chooses to take the risk. The operation ended up being a great success and with the increased blood flow in his brain, Homer's intelligence skyrocketed.
